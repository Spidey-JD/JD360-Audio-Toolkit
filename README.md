# 🎵 JD360 Audio Toolkit
A beginner-friendly tool for extracting and rebuilding audio for **Just Dance (Xbox 360)** `.wav.ckd` files.

This toolkit lets you:
- **Uncook** (`.wav.ckd` → `.wav`)
- **Recook** (edited `.wav` → new `.wav.ckd`)

Everything is interactive — drag files in, press a number, done.

No gatekeeping here.  
I developed this myself — no one else’s work was used.
